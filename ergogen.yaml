units:
  # `kx`/`ky`: The horizontal/vertical distance between
  # the "points" (i.e. the center points of the keys).
  #
  # `cx`/`cy` are built-in variables for Choc key width (18mm) and
  # height (17mm). I measured my Choc MBK blank keycaps with digital
  # calipers and I got a width of 16.5 mm and a height of 17.5 mm, so
  # it seems that the `cx`/`cy` already have some built-in padding.
  #
  # `u` is the built-in variable for cherry MX key width/height
  # (19mm). The width and height of MX keys are the same.
  kx: cx
  ky: cy
  #
  # Sets the width/height of the rectangles when rendering the keys in
  # the output SVG. By default, cherry MX size rectangles are used,
  # which is confusing/misleading since we are using Choc spacing for
  # the keyboard. I measured the real width/height of the Choc keycaps
  # (see above note), and it seems to be 0.5 mm less that `cx`/`cy` in
  # each dimension.
